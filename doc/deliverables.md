Under the CRAIG-DM system, we will need to present good documentation, explanation for our decisions apart from the practical demonstration. This means we'll need:

## Deliverables:
* Project Documentation
* Presentation deck
* Practical Demonstration

### Presentation Deck
Your presentation should include (in no particular order), but not limited to the following:
1. Introduction
    - Introduce what this project is about.
2. Problem/Data
    - Describe the fields in the data and the business domain.
